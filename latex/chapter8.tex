    This thesis developed a constraint programming methodology that operates
    directly of static single assigment compiler intermediate representation.

\section{Contributions}

    The major contributions are the introduction of two constraint programming
    languages with full implementations.
    Secondly, the formulation of important computational idioms in those.
    And third the prototyping of an integrated heterogeneous acceleration
    pipeline built on thta technology.

\section{Critical Analysis}

    Several iddues remain with the work.
    Only a finite number of variables.
    Programs difficult to debug.
    SSA model needs to be reconstructed whenever acting on the results.

\section{Future Work}

    Two of the buggest issues the presented constraint programming approaches
    are the difficulty of debugging the specifications and the restricted to a
    fixed number of variables in the underlying solver technology.
