    The scaling limitations of multi-core processor development have led to a
    diversification of the processor cores used within individual computers.
    Heterogeneous computing has become widespread, involving the cooperation of
    several structurally different processor cores.
    Central processor (CPU) cores are most frequently complemented with graphics
    processors (GPUs), which despite their name are suitable for many highly
    parallel computations besides computer graphics.
    Furthermore, deep learning accelerators are rapidly gaining relevance.

    Many applications could profit from heterogeneous computing but are held
    back by the surrounding software ecosystems.
    Heterogeneous systems are a challenge for compilers in particular, which
    usually target only the increasingly marginalised homogeneous CPU cores.
    Therefore, heterogeneous acceleration is primarily accessible via libraries
    and domain-specific languages (DSLs), requiring application rewrites and
    resulting in vendor lock-in.

    This thesis presents a compiler method for automatically targeting
    heterogeneous hardware from existing sequential C/C++ source code.
    A novel constraint programming methodology enables the declarative
    specification and automatic detection of {\em computational idioms} within
    compiler intermediate representation.
    Computational idioms denote algorithmic structures that commonly occur in
    performance-critical loops.
    Consequently, well-designed accelerator DSLs and libraries support
    computational idioms with their programming models and function interfaces.
    Examples of computational idioms are stencil codes, linear algebra,
    reductions and histogram computations.
    The detection of computational idioms in the middle end allows the
    compiler to incorporate dedicated DSL and library backends for code
    generation, which leverage domain knowledge for the efficient
    utilisation of heterogeneous accelerators.

    The constraint programming methodology is first derived on an abstract
    model and then implemented as an extension of LLVM.
    Two constraint programming languages are designed to target this
    implementation:
    the Compiler Analysis Description Language (CAnDL), and the extended
    Idiom Detection Language (IDL).
    These languages are evaluated on a range of different compiler problems,
    culminating in a complete heterogeneous acceleration pipeline integrated
    with the Clang C/C++ compiler.
    This pipeline was evaluated on the established benchmark collections NPB
    and Parboil.
    The approach was effective on 10 of the benchmark programs, resulting in
    significant speedups from 1.26$\times$ on ``histo'' to 275$\times$ on
    ``sgemm'' when starting from sequential baseline versions.

    In summary, the thesis shows that the automatic recognition of
    computational idioms during compilation enables the heterogeneous
    acceleration of sequential C/C++ programs.
    Constraint programming on compiler intermediate representation is a suitable
    method for formulating computational idioms for automatic detection
    with a constraint solver.
