abstract="Peephole optimizations optimize and canonicalize code to enable other optimizations but are error-prone. Our prior research on Alive, a domain-specific language for specifying LLVM's peephole optimizations, automatically verifies the correctness of integer-based peephole optimizations and generates C++ code for use within LLVM. This paper proposes Alive-FP, an automated verification framework for floating point based peephole optimizations in LLVM. Alive-FP handles a class of floating point optimizations and fast-math optimizations involving signed zeros, not-a-number, and infinities, which do not result in loss of accuracy. This paper provides multiple encodings for various floating point operations to account for the various kinds of undefined behavior and under-specification in the LLVM's language reference manual. We have translated all optimizations that belong to this category into Alive-FP. In this process, we have discovered seven wrong optimizations in LLVM.",

abstract="Implementing program optimizers is a task which swallows an enourmous amount of man-power. To reduce development time a simple and practial specification method is highly desirable. Such a method should comprise both program analysis and transformation. However, although several frameworks for program analysis exist, none of them can be used for analysis and transformation uniformly. This paper presents such a method. For program analysis we use a simple variant of graph rewrite systems (edge addition rewrite systems). For program transformation we apply more complex graph rewrite systems. Our specification method has been implemented prototypically in the optimizer generator OPTIMIX. OPTIMIX works with arbitrary intermediate languages and generates real-life program analyses and transformations. We demonstrate this by several examples and measurements.",

abstract="In this article we introduce a novel model for compilation and compiler construction, the CoSY(COmpiler SYstem) model. CoSy provides a framework for flexible combination and embedding of compiler phases --- called engines in the sequel --- such that the construction of parallel and (inter-procedural) optimizing compilers is facilitated. In CoSy a compiler writer may program some phase in a target language and embed it transparently --- without source code changes --- into different compiler contexts, such as with alternative phase order, speculative evaluation, parallel evaluation, and generate-and-test evaluation. Compilers constructed with CoSy can be tuned for different host systems (the system the compiler runs on, not the system it produces code for) and are transparently scalable for (shared memory) multiprocessor host configurations.",

    Abstract = {Modern parallel microprocessors deliver high performance on applications that expose substantial fine-grained data parallelism. Although data parallelism is widely available in many computations, implementing data parallel algorithms in low-level languages is often an unnecessarily difficult task. The characteristics of parallel microprocessors and the limitations of current programming methodologies motivate our design of Copperhead, a high-level data parallel language embedded in Python. The Copperhead programmer describes parallel computations via composition of familiar data parallel primitives supporting both flat and nested data parallel computation on arrays of data. Copperhead programs are expressed in a subset of the widely used Python programming language and interoperate with standard Python modules, including libraries for numeric computation, data visualization, and analysis.
In this paper, we discuss the language, compiler, and runtime features that enable Copperhead to efficiently execute data parallel code. We define the restricted subset of Python which Copperhead supports and introduce the program analysis techniques necessary for compiling Copperhead code into efficient low-level implementations. We also outline the runtime support by which Copperhead programs interoperate with standard Python modules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques with several examples targeting the CUDA platform for parallel programming on GPUs. Copperhead code is concise, on average requiring 3.6 times fewer lines of code than CUDA, and the compiler generates efficient code, yielding 45-100% of the performance of hand-crafted, well optimized CUDA code.}

  title = {Parboil: {{A Revised Benchmark Suite}} for {{Scientific}} and {{Commercial Throughput Computing}}},
  year = {2018},
  journal = {IMPACT Technical Report},
  shorttitle = {Parboil},
  abstract = {The Parboil benchmarks are a set of throughput computing applications useful for studying the performance of throughput computing architecture and compilers. The name comes from the culinary term for a partial cooking process, which represents our belief that useful throughput computing benchmarks must be "cooked", or preselected to implement a scalable algorithm with fine-grained parallel tasks. But useful benchmarks for this field cannot be "fully cooked", because the architectures and programming models and supporting tools are evolving rapidly enough that static benchmark codes will lose relevance very quickly. We have collected benchmarks from throughput computing application researchers in many different scientific and commercial fields including image processing, biomolecular simulation, fluid dynamics, and astronomy. Each benchmark includes several implementations. Some implementations we provide as readable base implementations from which new optimization efforts can begin, and others as examples of the current state-of-the-art targeting specific CPU and GPU architectures. As we continue to optimize these benchmarks for new and existing architectures ourselves, we will also gladly accept new implementations and benchmark contributions from developers to recognize those at the frontier of performance optimization on each architecture. Finally, by including versions of varying levels of optimization of the same fundamental algorithm, the bench-marks present opportunities to demonstrate tools and architectures that help programmers get the most out of their parallel hardware. Less optimized versions are presented as challenges to the compiler and architecture research communities: to develop the technology that automatically raises the performance of simpler implementations to the performance level of sophisticated programmer-optimized implementations, or demonstrate any other performance or programmability improvements. We hope that these benchmarks will facilitate effective demonstrations of such technology.},

Its optimization, which is intimately associated with the data structures used to store the sparse matrix, has always been of particular interest to the applied mathematics and computer science communities and has attracted further attention since the advent of multicore architectures. In this article, we present SparseX, an open source software package for SpMV targeting multicore platforms, that employs the state-of-the-art Compressed Sparse eXtended (CSX) sparse matrix storage format to deliver high efficiency through a highly usable ``BLAS-like'' interface that requires limited or no tuning. Performance results indicate that our library achieves superior performance over competitive libraries on large-scale problems.},

    Abstract = {Large software systems are expensive to develop and maintain.  A significant amount of programmer activity in understanding, changing, and debugging these systems is information management. To support these activities more directly, we have designed a programming environment, called OMEGA, that provides powerful mechanisms for accessing and displaying the information in a large software system.  <p>  OMEGA uses successful ideas from existing programming environments while trying to correct deficiencies. The major deficiency in these systems is that programmers can only view and manipulate a single logical representation of programs.  <p>  To support multiple representations, OMEGA uses a relational database system to manage all program information. Using a database system provides a powerful mechanism for efficient access to a variety of cross-sections of program information, as well as providing traditional database facilities such as concurrency control, data integrity, and crash recovery.  <p>  The user interface to OMEGA separates input specification from output display, relies on pointing rather than typing, and exploits interaction in semantic analysis to detect many errors as soon as they are made. By eliminating the traditional textual interface to programs, OMEGA also allows the unification of the different abstraction mechanisms present in traditional programming environments.<p>  We have experimented with the ideas in OMEGA by designing a relational schema for software written in a particular programming language, and by implementing a program that transfers existing programs, stored as text, into a database managed by an "off-the-shelf" database system. A prototype visual interface to the program database has also been implemented.  <p>The results of this thesis are new models of program representation and user interaction for software development systems. The model of program representation can be expressed in the relational data model, and software can therefore be manipulated easily and powerfully using relational calculus. Our experimental implementation demonstrates the feasibility of using a relational database system, and provides insights into potential problems and how they might be solved.}

The executable code it produces is proved to behave exactly as specified by the semantics of the source C program. This article gives an overview of the use of CompCert to gain certification credits for a highly safety-critical industry application, certified according to IEC 60880. We will briefly introduce the target application, illustrate the process of changing the existing compiler infrastructure to CompCert, and discuss performance characteristics. The main part focuses on the tool qualification strategy, in particular on how to take advantage of the formal correctness proof in the certification process.}
